# Global-Methane-Emissions-Widget

This repository contains the code for an interactive global map of methane emissions by country. 
The data used in this exercise was downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishraut64/global-methane-emissions), 
although the units were corrected to Mt instead of kt in accordance with values reported by the International Energy Agency (https://www.iea.org/reports/global-methane-tracker-2022/overview#).

The HTML file and Python notebook files are also included in this repository. 
Note that I have replaced my Plotly Chart Studio credentials with "MyUsername" and "MyAPIKey" in the notebook file to protect my personal information.
